                <p>
                    Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is <b>Tenzin Choden</b>, and I am currently pursuing a
                    <b>Bachelor of Education (B.Ed)</b> at <b>Samtse College of Education</b>.
                    I am deeply passionate about teaching, technology, and creativity, and
                    I believe in combining all three to make learning exciting and meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic journey has taught me the importance of <i>adaptability</i> and
                    <i>lifelong learning</i>. I enjoy experimenting with web design,
                    database management, and programming, which I see as essential
                    tools to create modern and engaging learning experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond my studies, I love taking part in collaborative projects that
                    allow me to learn from others and share my own ideas. I often spend time
                    exploring emerging technologies, reading educational blogs, and
                    building small projects to apply what I have learned in real life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My vision is to become an educator who inspires curiosity, builds confidence,
                    and integrates digital tools into classrooms to make education
                    <i>accessible, interactive, and fun for all learners</i>. âœ¨
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside academics, I enjoy reading, designing creative layouts,
                    and working on personal growth. I see every new challenge as a step toward
                    becoming the kind of teacher who motivates students to not only gain
                    knowledge but also develop the courage to dream big.
                </p>
